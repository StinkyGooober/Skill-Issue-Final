            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="headp">We are Skill Issue. We began playing music in April 2025, and we are from a small town called Fort Thomas in northern Kentucky. We have 3 members: Hunter Cole, Emmett Young and Eli Daly. For now, we are just a small cover band, but we will upgrade to our own unique music, and eventually start playing live.  You can support us by watching our content on Youtube!</p>
